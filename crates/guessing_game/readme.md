# Guessing Game

This is a customized version of the Guessing Game, developed in [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html) of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book) book, for Rust version `1.78.0`.

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/herberthleao/rust-book-exercises.git
```

Go to this crate's directory:

cd rust-book-exercises/src/guessing_game
```

crate run
```

## Usage

The idea of ​​the game is very simple: guess the secret number. The game will ask for a suggestion of what the secret number is and, once entered, will give feedback informing you whether the number entered is greater or less than the number to be discovered, or whether it was correct. This must be repeated until the number is discovered, which is when the game ends.

Good luck!
